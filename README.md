# Epic-shop
Pet shop dApp for Epics

### Setup
- install Ganache local testnet
- install Metamask with following updates below
- (optional) VsCode extension for solidity files
- install truffle following instructions

start with command `npm run dev`

Based on the truffle pet shop tutorial https://www.trufflesuite.com/tutorials/pet-shop

Setup is the same, however when you install MetaMask, there is an update with 'Network ID' that doesn't exist in Ganache.
Go to settings in Ganache and change the network ID to 1337 to match Metamask.
When creating a metamask account, use the seed phrase from your Ganache.
